### Go

[Advent-of-code](https://github.com/PezzA/advent-of-code) contains solutions to puzzles from the https://adventofcode.com/ programming challenge site.  ~250 of the 300 puzzles are completed from the 2015-2020 events.

[Advent-of-wasm](https://github.com/PezzA/advent-of-wasm) takes the code from the advent-of-code repo and surfaces it on the web, by delivering it as a wasm module.  The main purpose of this is to also provide a platform for visualisations of the puzzles output.

[Flaten](https://github.com/PezzA/flaten) is in incorrectly spelled 'Flatten'.  This is a collapse style game, the main focus of which was to project a full and, as much as I can manage, polished.  The game is written in Go, and delivered via WASM.
